Path Planning Algorithm Used - DIJKSTRA'S ALGORITHM (Used for route planning / shortest path navigation)
This is one of the most common algorithms taught in engineering projects, especially for:
 • Waypoint path planning
 • Finding the shortest, safest route
 • Navigation from Point A → B
 • Avoiding obstacles by recalculating path

Dijkstra is widely used in robotics and UAV systems for deterministic and reliable path planning.

✅ Why Dijkstra Makes Sense for Your Project?
 • Identify optimal GPS waypoint paths
 • Reduce flight time and battery consumption
 • Avoid restricted or unsafe zones
 • Improve efficiency of autonomous navigation
